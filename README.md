# **PySearch**

## A faster way to code

**PySearch** provides intelligent completion suggestions that improve on ordinary Google search, by incorporating the context surrounding each query and learning on the fly.


## Getting Started:

0. (Optional) Add your python runtime to the PySearch config.

  `View -> Toggle Command Palate -> Settings View: View Installed Packages -> PySearch Settings`

1. Create or Open a Python file in a Project Folder:

  `File -> Add Project Folder`

  `[right-click] -> New File`

2. Follow prompt to download [pyls](https://github.com/palantir/python-language-server)

  Or..

  Run `pip install python-language-server` in the command-line

  `View -> Toggle Command Palate -> Window: Reload`

3. Install non-standard libraries in your python runtime to begin making PySearch queries

  e.g. `pip install sklearn`


## Using PySearch:

To make a PySearch query, type the delimiter (`!!` *by default*) to begin a search:

For more control over query results, try adding the `--context` flag (alias `-c`) anywhere in your query
to scale context sensitivity.

The `--context` flag takes integer values from `0` through `5`, where higher numbers increase context sensitivity.

While PySearch searches only functions across Python 3.7+, broader coverage is currently in alpha. Our search indexes are hosted in PySearch Cloud, and we're actively working on rolling out a local version. All requests are TLS/SSL encrypted, anonymized, and **never** sold or shared.

## Troubleshooting

1. If PySearch queries aren't working, check the logs to confirm the server started successfully:

  `View -> Developer -> Toggle Developer Tools`

  Check the `Console` tab for `PySearch server is starting up`

2. Atom uses events to trigger the server startup process, so try reloading the window if you aren't getting PySearch results (as the server may never have been triggered, or pyls may have died)

  `View -> Toggle Command Palate -> Window: Reload`

3. If the server startup isn't initiated upon reloading, you may not have opened your Python file in an active workspace (see "Getting Started" step #1)

4. If your PySearch results aren't including non standard library packages, check that the package is installed in your python runtime in "Getting Started" step #3.
